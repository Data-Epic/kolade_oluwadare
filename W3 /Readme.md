# OVERVIEW
This reposotory provides a guide on variables, data types, and commenting in python.
Understanding this concept is crucial for writhing clear and maintanable code
# TABLE OF CONTENT
1. Variables
2. data type
3. Comments
# VARIABLES
Variables are containers for storing data values in python, a variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.
Naming Conventions
1. Variables name can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.

3. str: Stringe type (e.g "Hello, World!")
4. bool: Boolean type ('True', or'False')
# COMMENTS
Comment are used to explain the code and make it more readable. They are ignored by python interpreter
# TYPES OF COMMENTS
1. Single line Comments: Created using the '#' symbol.
2. Multi-line Comments: Enclosed in tripple quotes
3. Inline Comments: Brief comments on the same line as code
# CONCLUSION
Mastering variables, data types, and commenting in python is essential for writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
